/**
 * Centralized Tooltip Content Definitions
 *
 * This file contains all tooltip content for the Smart Resolution Calculator node.
 * Each tooltip has three levels:
 * - quick: Short 1-2 sentence description (shown after hoverDelay ms)
 * - full: Extended 3-5 sentence explanation with examples (shown after fullDelay ms)
 * - docsUrl: Optional link to external documentation (opened on icon click)
 * - hoverDelay: Optional custom delay in milliseconds (default 250ms)
 *
 * To add tooltips to new widgets:
 * 1. Add content here with widget name as key
 * 2. Import TOOLTIP_CONTENT in smart_resolution_calc.js
 * 3. Create InfoIcon with TOOLTIP_CONTENT.widget_name
 * 4. Call icon.draw() and icon.mouse() in widget methods
